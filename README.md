<h1 align="center">Project Management Capstone</h1>

I have recently completed the Project Management Pathway course, organized by The Knowledge House, that has provided me with project management knowledge and experience in managing and delivering projects. I had the opportunity to serve as both a Scrum Master and Project Manager for a capstone project which allowed me to apply the methodologies and principles that I learned throughout this course. 

In my role as Scrum Master and Project Manager, I facilitated Agile project management practices and fostered an environment of collaboration working alongside the project team, which included a Lead Program Manager, Technical Project Manager, and Project Coordinators. I managed project management software such as Trello and Jira to prioritize tasks and conducted sprint planning, stand-ups, and sprint retrospectives. I enjoyed my responsibility to ensure and execute a successful and timely deliverable to the teamâ€™s client. Understanding the importance of teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, I coordinated cross-functional teams while keeping in mind the priority of the project goal and expectations. 

This experience to contribute to and lead project teams to deliver high-quality results has hardened my passion and eagerness to continue my journey in this field.

For the Capstone project I worked with the **Growth Team at The Wikimedia Foundation** to deliver a consolidated artifact.
