<h1 align="center">Project Management Capstone</h1>

I have recently completed The Knowledge House's Project Management Pathway course, which has equipped me with valuable project management knowledge and practical experience in effectively managing and delivering projects. During this course, I had the privilege of taking on dual roles as both a Scrum Master and Project Manager for a capstone project, enabling me to put into practice the methodologies and principles I had learned.

In my capacity as a Scrum Master and Project Manager, I played a pivotal role in facilitating Agile project management practices and fostering a collaborative environment within a multidisciplinary project team. This team included a Lead Program Manager, Technical Project Manager, and Project Coordinators. Utilizing project management software such as Trello and Jira, I skillfully prioritized tasks and conducted essential activities like sprint planning, stand-up meetings, and sprint retrospectives. My understanding of the critical aspects of teamwork, leadership, and effective communication allowed me to coordinate these cross-functional teams while consistently keeping the project's goals and expectations at the forefront.

I found great satisfaction in my responsibility to ensure the successful and timely delivery of our project to the client. This experience of contributing to and leading project teams towards delivering high-quality results has reinforced my passion and enthusiasm to further pursue a career in this dynamic field.
